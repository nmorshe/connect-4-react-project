# Project Details

This project was a part of online coursework on learning React. Essentially this app serves as a basic connect-4 app capable of handling 1-2 players as well as a simple AI player to play against.

This project serves as a part of my first foray into React development, while also teaching me certain parts about the CI/CD pipeline as well as deployment. I utilized render.com for static website deployment.

Due to some issues, I had to deviate from the course a little and use Vite instead of the normal create-react-app method from Node.js.
