# Project Details

This project was a part of my coursework for an online class on Udemy. Essentially this app serves as a basic connect-4 app capable of handling 1-2 players as well as a simple AI player to play against.

This project serves as a part of my first foray into React development, while also teaching me certain parts about the CI/CD pipeline as well as deployment. I utilized render.com for static website deployment.
